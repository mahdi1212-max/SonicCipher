# 🔊 SonicCipher

SonicCipher is a Python-based project that allows encoding and decoding text messages using audio frequencies. It converts text into a WAV audio file by modulating bits into tones, and can later decode them from real-time microphone input or existing audio files.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 Text-to-audio encoding using two distinct frequencies (FSK)
- 📥 Live decoding from microphone input (e.g. antenna/aux cable)
- 🎵 WAV file playback and decoding
- 💾 Save and load encoded messages as audio files
- 🖼️ GUI built with Tkinter for ease of use
